# Introduction
In the primordial landscape of programming languages, where the echoes of innovation reverberated through the binary canyons, a language emerged with the thunderous roar of prehistoric beasts and the finesse of ancient civilizations. Behold Dino, a programming language that transcends the ordinary, weaving a narrative of code that echoes the majesty of a time long before algorithms ruled the world. Every line of Dino code is an expedition into the untamed wilderness of creativity, where developers embark on a journey reminiscent of a Jurassic odyssey. This language, curated by the visionary minds of coding pioneers, channels the raw power of dinosaurs into its expressive syntax, turning each program into a thrilling adventure that leaves an indelible mark on the digital terrain.

## Features
* Dino Expressions: Channel the raw power of dinosaurs into your code with expressive syntax.
* Fossilized Functions: Define functions that transcend the temporal boundaries, ensuring the endurance and discoverability of your code.
* T-Rex Types: Immerse yourself in the world of strongly typed variables, fortified with the fierceness of a T-Rex. Dino's type system guarantees the creation of robust and reliable programs, ensuring that your code stands tall and unyielding, just like the legendary predator that inspired it.
* Stegosaurus Scoping: Navigate the coding landscape with the protective prowess of a Stegosaurus's spiked tail. Embrace static scoping in Dino, where variables are shielded within their designated domains, ensuring a secure and well-defined environment for your code to flourish.
* Dinos are simple! Mix of JS and python, not parenthesis in if/while/for statements, but does have brackets where it makes sense.
* Overall Dinosaur simple syntax. 


###Other Notes/Constraints
* Identifiers have to be declared before they are used. The Dino comes from an egg first!
* Usage of identifiers without initialization is forbidden, mirroring the disciplined order observed in the prehistoric world.
* Uniqueness reigns supreme, as identifiers must be singular within their scope, mirroring the individuality of each species in the coding ecosystem.
* Access modifiers, the guardians of code privacy, dictate the visibility of identifiers, ensuring a harmonious coexistence within the Dino kingdom.
* Variable assignments adhere to a stringent rule â€“ only variables of the same type may be interlinked. A deviation from this rule invokes the wrath of errors, maintaining the harmony of variable types. I.E. int x = "hello"  throws Error.  or assigning a previously declared string variable to a previously declared int variable.
* Arguments/Calls must match up with number of parameters. Explicit declarations bind them in a symbiotic relationship, harmonizing the elements of Dino code. Explicitly you must say xyz( first = 150 , second = 250)  as opposed to xyz(150,250)
* The primal commands of 'break' and 'continue' are restricted to the rhythmic beats of loops, echoing the cyclical nature of the prehistoric dance of life.
* The command 'return' finds its sanctuary solely within the confines of a function.
* Declared variables, akin to ancient relics, must be respected and acknowledged, their presence acknowledged by usage or reading, safeguarding the balance between creation and utilization in the Dino realm.
* Cannot have non-boolean value in a conditional or while loop.
* For loops only take integer values.
