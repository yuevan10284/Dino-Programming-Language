# Introduction
Once upon a time, in a land before time, there was a programming language that roared with creativity and ruled the realm of coding. Welcome to Dino, a language where every line of code is a prehistoric adventure waiting to be uncovered. Embrace the power of the dinosaurs as you write programs that stomp through the digital landscape, leaving a trail of Jurassic joy.

## Features
* Dino Expressions: Channel the raw power of dinosaurs into your code with expressive syntax.
* Fossilized Functions: Define functions that stand the test of time, just like ancient fossils waiting to be discovered.
* T-Rex Types: Strongly typed with a touch of T-Rex fierceness, ensuring robust and reliable programs.
* Stegosaurus Scoping: Embrace static scoping, where variables are as well-protected as a Stegosaurus's spiked tail.


###Other Notes/Constraints
* Identifiers have to be declared before they are used.
* They may not be used in a place where they have not been initialized.
* Identifiers must be unique in scope
* Identifiers must be used according to their scope, and access modifiers aka private, public.
* Assigning variables must be of the same type. I.E. int x = "hello"  throws Error.  or assigning a previously declared string variable to a previously declared int variable.
* Arguments/Calls must match up with number of parameters. Explicitly you must say xyz( first = 150 , second = 250)  as opposed to xyz(150,250)
* break/continue statements may only appear in a loop.
* Return may only appear in a function.
* Declared variables must be read or used once.
